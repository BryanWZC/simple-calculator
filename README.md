# Simple Calculator
&nbsp;
A simple calculator that runs arithmetic functions and stores the last 5 results to be seen in the history section. Website available via this [link].
&nbsp;
### How to run:
1. Install Node.js, React and Mathjs.
1. Use `npm start`
&nbsp;

### Lessons learned:
&nbsp;
Gained a better understanding of the life-cycle methods of React.js from this exercise. Also, learned more about transitions.
&nbsp;
### Improvements to be made:
&nbsp;
Definitely as far as a calculator goes, I could add in more functions (also thanks to the Mathjs library) such as trigonometric functions or giving the calculator the ability to solve derivatives and matrix functions. However, there are better technologies out there such as Matlab that will be able to do it significantly better.
